[h1]Even It Out[/h1]

This mod revamps the difficulty-settings of the game.
The intention is to have a more scaled experience with no need to adjust your playstyle in a whole because you step up the difficulty.

A good example of this is the fact it is very difficult to compete with the AI on building wonders or holy-sites on deity, this mod allows you to
be able to do just that, but things getting tough the more the game progresses.

Does not work with other mods that modify aspects of the game this mod changes.
